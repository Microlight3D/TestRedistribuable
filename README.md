# Test Redistribuable

## What is this repository ?
This repository is made and used by Microlight 3D's developement team. The objective is to test releases using the installer, without making problems to the users. It is in public to properly simulate any other redistribuable we use.

## Should I use it ?
If you're not in the Microlight 3D Developement team, then, no. You will find here releases that are voluntarily broken, or older release, or even non-software, dedicated to do test. Microlight 3D is not responsible for your usage of anything found here.

## What then ?
If you're looking for a Phaos version, you can find [the github repository here](https://github.com/Microlight3D/PhaosRedistribuable). For Luminis, it's [right there](https://github.com/Microlight3D/LuminisRedistribuable). But in all cases, just use the latest Installer instead of using github directly, it simplifies the install process. You can always download the latest installer [right there](https://github.com/Microlight3D/Installer/releases/latest/download/ML3DInstallerSetup.exe).
